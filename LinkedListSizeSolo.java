/**
Add a method size to our implementation of the LinkedList class that computes the number of elements
in the list by following links and counting the elements until the end of the list is reached.
Do this recursively by calling a recursive helper method

private static int size(Node start)
Hint: If start is null, then the size is 0. Otherwise, it is one larger than the size of start.next.

Implement the method in the LinkedList class and test your implementation using the SizeTester class.
